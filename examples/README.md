# Examples

Example scripts demonstrating the use of cspace-refname.

These examples utilize features of JavaScript [ES2015](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme) that are not yet natively supported in Node.js. To run an example script, first use [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to compile it to JavaScript ES5. The `babel-node` program from the [Babel CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/) package may be used to compile and execute a script using a single command:

```
$ ../node_modules/.bin/babel-node read.js
```
